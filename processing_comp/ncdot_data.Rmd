Reading and processing data from NC DOT Received May 13th, 2024 from Meredith Vick (msvick@ncdot.gov) - "Please see attached.  Our construction unit indicated we canâ€™t create the formats requested but did add in a couple more columns that were shown on the STIP list (counties, route numbers).  The output of our contract admin software shows each county and route in a line by itself, so there will be multiple lines for each contract."

```{r}
all_projects <- read_excel('../data/Completed Project List_withOSMids_noquo.xlsm')
widening <- all_projects %>% filter(grepl("WIDENING",`Contract Description`))
```


```{r}
contracts <- widening %>% group_by(`Contract Number`) %>% summarise(county = first(County), location = first(`Location Description`), description = first(`Contract Description`), routettype = first(`Route Type`), routenum = first(`Route Number`), date = max(`Acceptance Date`), nchunks = n()) %>% arrange(date) #not totally correct route number, which is somehow different for each of the chunks

#widening <- widening %>% mutate(id_list = split(OSMids, ' '))
```

Example: SR-1003 (CAMDEN RD) FROM EAST OF OAKLAND AVE TO NORTH OF SR-1007 (OWEN DR).

This link shows it was actually a multiphase project: https://www.fayettevillenc.gov/Home/Components/News/News/6761/397?arch=1

Toss borders, cut big projects, cut by number of lanes? or a state classification (use state roads database)

1. Remove anything within X distance of a border (thinking 20 or 30 miles)
2. Remove anything classified as 'motorway'
3. Remove any combined segment longer than 10 miles

I'm running this all on *wide_contracts* right now because it's easier to make sure I'm treating all the segments of one contract together, but will eventually want to switch back to wide_roads probably so that I keep the matching OSMids. or maybe i go back and extract them via overlap or something?

```{r}
nc_counties <- counties("NC") %>% st_transform(crs=st_crs(32616))
nc_poly <- states() %>% filter(GEOID == 37) %>% st_transform(crs=st_crs(32616))
nc_inner <- st_buffer(nc_poly, -30000)
#plot(nc_inner)

length_threshold <- 15000 #-> need a histogram of segment lengths
units(length_threshold) <- "m"

# 38 contracts originally pre filtering
shortlist <- wide_contracts %>% filter(highway != "motorway") %>% # goes down to 36 after this
  st_filter(nc_inner, .predicate = st_within) %>% # now 21 with 30km buffer, this cuts some coastal stuff that probably doesn't need to be cut
  mutate(contract_length = st_length(.)) %>%
  filter(contract_length < length_threshold) %>% # now 19 for contracts less than 15 km
  filter(date > as.Date("2019-01-01")) %>% # now 15
  filter(date < as.Date("2022-01-01")) # now 10
  
tm_shape(shortlist) + tm_lines(col='date', id='name', palette = "RdBu")

#write_sf(shortlist, "expansions_shortlist_20240805.shp")

#instead of cutting stuff out, just adding additional labels. highway label already in there, no need to add
expanded_tagged <- wide_contracts %>% mutate(inner_state_30km = as.numeric(st_within(wide_contracts, nc_inner)) > 0) %>% # add a label for things in the inner region (not 30 km)
  mutate(contract_length = st_length(.)) %>% # add a length label
  select(-OSMids) %>% # dropping these because they don't write well to shapefile and i'd rather re-read them later
  st_transform(crs = st_crs(4326)) # to match the routes data

write_sf(expanded_tagged, "../data/all_expansions_ncdot_data.shp") # use this file in label_od

"Battleground Avenue" - https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/us-220-widening-greensboro/Documents/december-2018-public-comment-summary.pdf, http://grra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fall-2018-1.pdf, may be too big (filter out trunk too?)

"Camden Road" - press release: https://www.fayettevillenc.gov/Home/Components/News/News/6761/ this shows that while the acceptance date is 2019, half of the project opened by 2017
more construction more recently, https://www.nc-eminent-domain.com/latest-projects/camden-road-widening/     this seems related: https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/fayetteville-outer-loop/Pages/project-highlights.aspx
